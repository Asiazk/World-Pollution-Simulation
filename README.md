  Simulation of pollution levels affects on average temperature
    The world is represented as biological automata
    Each cell can be part of: Land, Sea, Iceberg, Forest, Town
    Each cell has fields: Temperature, Wind (direction and intensity), Rain, Pollution, Cloud
    Each iteration = one day

    SW requirements: Python 3.9
    Make sure all py files are in the same folder: main, gui, utils, consts, wind, cell
    Run from command prompt from folder: Windows: main.py, Linux: python ./main.py
