Simulation of pollution levels affects on average temperature
    The world is represented as biological automata
    Each cell can be part of: Land, Sea, Iceberg, Forest, Town
    Each cell has fields: Temperature, Wind (direction and intensity), Rain, Pollution, Cloud
    Each iteration = one day
    Conclusion: Higher pollution levels affect average temperature within time
